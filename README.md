# 👍Conculusion

Finally winter, 2021, I was Distributed the site to Ajou University Student. But It had not good  performance. Because It have not let know "how to use this site?" Many people don't have interesting this site. It is mean my site is unkind for user. 

Second, Mysite lack promotion. I think that It is need Management approach is required. 

Still, First site when I was 19. It was clean and a lot to learn. After that, I will do web development using React, not Django. I will come back from the military and develop further to bring better results! (In military 22.02.14 ~ 23.08.13)
